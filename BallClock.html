As a team, we developed code to compress, and then decompress,  pbm files.
  As part of the compression process we used huffman encoding. 
  Teams competed against each other for best performance. 
  Part of the project included switching code bases with another team halfway through
  so we could learn what it’s like to inherit another person/group’s code. 
  (and how to leave good code for future inheritors.)
