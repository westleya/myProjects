  I used the Keras wrapper around Tensorflow in Python for this project.
  I was tasked with classifying different fonts with different models then comparing how the models
  fared in classifying the symbols in each font and evaluating their performance as well as trying to
  determine the cause of misclassifications.

There are two assignments in this repository: the character recognition assignment previously described
  and a digit classification assignment. In the digit classification assignment the digits are handwritten
  and I used SVMs and KNN to perform classification.
