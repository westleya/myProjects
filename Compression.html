  The purpose of this assignment was to introduce us to discrete events by coding for different queuing strategies.
  The strategies this simulator compared were the ‘bank’ strategy and the ‘supermarket’ strategy. 
  The bank has one line that all the tellers service and the supermarket has a line per cashier. 
  The assertion to prove was that bank lines are more efficient.
