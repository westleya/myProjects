  My partner, <a href = "https://github.com/douggarding">Doug </a>, and I developed controllers for a learning management system 
  similar to canvas.  The controllers were required to interface with the Model and Views. (provided by the professor) 
  The database was our own, with tables for users, departments, courses, assignments, etc.
