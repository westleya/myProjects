//  Cats are favored when there are none of one of the other
//  groups (Dogs xor Birds) or when there are only cats.
//  For any combination including cats, dogs and birds
//  dogs and birds are favored.
//      The sum of dogs and birds likely never runs down to 0.
//  So, the cat threads only get to run once, at the very end.
//  (The total cats typically adds up to the number of cat threads
//  I allocated in the product scheme)
