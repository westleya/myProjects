<p>
The purpose of this assignment was to compare the performance of three different spatial partitioning 
 data structures: bins, KD-trees, and QuadTrees. I coded each of the structures in C++. 
 The code for the points was provided.  I tested each data structure under a variety of conditions, 
 then evaluated their performance in Python.
